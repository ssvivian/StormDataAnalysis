# Storm Data Analysis Project

Project developed as part of the Reproducible Research Course offered by the Johns Hopkins University on Coursera.

The goal of this project was to explore the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) [storm database](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2FStormData.csv.bz2), provided by the [National Weather Service](https://www.weather.gov), to analyze how storms and other severe weather events, which can result in fatalities, injuries, and property damage, cause public health and economic problems for communities.

The data analysis was intended to address the following questions:

1. Across the United States, which types of events are most harmful with respect to population health?
2. Across the United States, which types of events have the greatest economic consequences?

The R Markdown file `storm_data_analysis.Rmd` contains both the code and the documentation for the data analysis conducted to answer these questions. The final HTML report can also be viewed [here](http://www.rpubs.com/vivianss/542566).
